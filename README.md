micro-php-file-manager
======================

Very small, lightweight, feature-lacking application to assist in simple file management on a server.
This tool is intended to mediate repetitive, simple, consistent file operations.

For example, this application is useful if you:
-frequently move/copy files from one set directory to another
-want to provide limited operations/access to non-technical users
-want to perform basic file operations that would otherwise require an FTP client or similar
-et cetera.

This application is not an all-purpose file management tool.
It is not intended to replace a user's FTP client, cpanel tools, ssh client, etc.
Rather, this application aims to simplify repetitive processes that a user would not want to use a full-sized client for.
